This is the repository for the NFT Enigma project.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create an NFT marketplace with an RPG type setting. Users will be able to collect items, armor, weapons and runes in order to build their "Character".

## Inspiration

Primary inspiration for this project goes to Diablo 2 and OpenSea. Hopefully creating a link between NFT Marketplaces and RPG video games.

## Usage

Feel free to fork this repository. Once cloned you can start the project by installing dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run the development server:
```bash
$ npm install
```
