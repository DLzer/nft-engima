# NFT Enigma üó°Ô∏è

This is the repository for the NFT Enigma project.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create an NFT marketplace with an RPG type setting. Users will be able to collect items, armor, weapons and runes in order to build their "Character".

Users will be able to:
- Contribute to weekly "Boss Battles" in return for item ( NFT ) drops.
- Use & combine dropped items and equip them to build your character.
- Display your character on your profile and gain strength + additional skills to be more effective in battles.
- Gain achievements for collecting certain sets and competing in Battles, Tournaments and PVP Fights! 

## Inspiration

Primary inspiration for this project goes to Diablo 2 and OpenSea. Hopefully creating a link between NFT Marketplaces and RPG video games.

## Usage
